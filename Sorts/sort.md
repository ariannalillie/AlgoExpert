# SORTING

## What is sorting?
Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some sort of order.


## Bubble Sort

## Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort

## Merge Sort

## Quick Sort
* Like merge sorts exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted.
* Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") an d finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array.
