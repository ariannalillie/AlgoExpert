1. When project requirements say 'Dead Link Free', does that just mean there arent links that 404? Like buttons that are added for the sake of the clones appearance, but don't have any functionality are not considered deadlinks?

more or less. basically if there is a button on your page, there should be some immediate action. Someone shouldnâ€™t keep clicking it trying to figure out what it does.

2. I'm following the instructions on the readme to set up. But it is throwing an error on the first line of code. It says the requirements files don't exist but they do.

Wrong directory




First feature done by Monday.
